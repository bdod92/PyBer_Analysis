# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to generate ride-sharing data for Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. This data can potentially be used to make business decisions on how to price rides, allocate drivers, and / or determine hiring needs. Additionally, the fare by city type over the course of a year will help to determine rates during high and low seasons.

## Results
### Total Rides
The total number of rides increases as the population density increases. ie ride count follows: Urban > Suburban > Rural.

### Total Drivers
The total number of drivers increases as the population density increases. ie driver count follows: Urban > Suburban > Rural.

### Total Fares
The total accumulated fare amount increases as the population density increases. ie total accumulated fare follows: Urban > Suburban > Rural.

### Average Fare per Ride
Conversely, the average fare per ride decreases as the population density increases. ie average fare per ride follows: Urban < Suburban < Rural.

### Average Fare per Driver
The average fare per driver decreases as the population density increases. ie average fare per driver follows: Urban < Suburban < Rural.

### Summary
The figure below illustrates the data presented above.
